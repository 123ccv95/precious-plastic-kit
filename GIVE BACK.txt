Finished?
Awesome!

1: It would be really great if you could share a few pictures of the things you made in our community.
This is SUPER valuable feedback information for us and probably an inspiration for others: https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/forum/precious-plastic/creations/

2: We started a map to gather all worldwide development, we will add you here as soon as you started your own topic. This way people could get in contact and learn from your experience, together we can boost plastic recycling worldwide!

3: Use hashtag #preciousplastic to share your updates on social media, we love to see this!


We will use all the above information to find stuff from the community and post it on http://lab.preciousplastic.com


KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!





*As an inspiration you can have a look at Mattia’s post on his Hacked Extrusion Machine. We love long and detailed articles like that one but we’re generally very happy to see even shorter version with a few images, reflection and considerations.
